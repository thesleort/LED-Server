# LED Server

Program for controlling big displays using Colorlight LED.

## Conductor
Control panel of all media to be displayed on the big displays.

## Sender card control
Implementation of proprietary Colorlight LED protocol. This is a planned feature, which requires reverse engineering the packets sent from a Colorlight LED sender card to big displays over ethernet.

Implementation of this will allow configuration of displays using Linux.
